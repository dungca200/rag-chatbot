description: Broad strategic research across multiple domains for decision-making and knowledge gathering. Use when users ask for general research, need information synthesis from multiple sources, want to understand complex topics, or need research that doesn't fit market/competitive/technology categories. Triggers on queries like "research X topic", "what do we know about Y", "investigate Z", "help me understand [topic]", or "find information on [subject]".

# General Strategic Research

Conduct comprehensive research across domains to inform strategic decisions.

## Workflow

1. **Define scope** - Clarify the research question, purpose, and depth needed
2. **Gather sources** - Search web, academic sources, and relevant databases
3. **Synthesize** - Analyze and connect information across sources
4. **Deliver** - Present in requested format (report or brief)

## Output Formats

### Quick Brief (default for simple queries)

Use for fast information needs:

```
# [Topic] Brief

**Key Insight:** [One sentence main takeaway]

**Summary:** [2-3 paragraph synthesis]

**Key Points:**
- [Important finding 1]
- [Important finding 2]
- [Important finding 3]

**Implications:** [What this means for the user's context]

**Sources:** [Key sources]
```

### Structured Report (for comprehensive research)

Use when user requests deep research or says "full report":

```
# Research Report: [Topic]

## Executive Summary
[Key findings and conclusions in 2-3 paragraphs]

## Background
- Context and relevance
- Why this matters
- Scope of research

## Methodology
- Sources consulted
- Research approach
- Limitations

## Findings

### [Theme/Section 1]
[Detailed findings with supporting evidence]

### [Theme/Section 2]
[Detailed findings with supporting evidence]

### [Theme/Section 3]
[Detailed findings with supporting evidence]

## Analysis
- Synthesis of findings
- Patterns and connections
- Conflicting information (if any)

## Conclusions
- Main takeaways
- Confidence levels
- Knowledge gaps

## Recommendations
1. [Actionable recommendation based on findings]
2. [Actionable recommendation based on findings]

## Sources
[Comprehensive list of sources used]

## Appendix (if needed)
[Supporting data, detailed breakdowns, additional context]
```

## Research Approach

- Start with clear research questions
- Use multiple source types (web, academic, industry, news)
- Cross-reference facts across sources
- Distinguish between established facts, expert opinions, and speculation
- Note source credibility and recency
- Identify conflicting information and explain discrepancies
- Focus on answering the user's actual question
- Provide actionable synthesis, not just data collection
